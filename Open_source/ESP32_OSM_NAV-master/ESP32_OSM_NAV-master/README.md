# ESP32-S3 Car Navigation Display

ESP32-S3 offline car navigation display. Renders OSM map tiles (from SD, WiFi
fallback), follows the car via BLE from your phone (route + position + next-turn
nav), and can route itself offline across the whole of Vietnam using a compact
road graph loaded from SD.

Board: **2.8" IPS ESP32-S3 + ILI9341** (ES3C28P / ES3N28P).

## Hardware

- ESP32-S3, 240 MHz, **16 MB flash, 8 MB octal PSRAM**
- ILI9341 320×240 landscape over SPI2 @ **80 MHz** (MOSI=11, MISO=13, CLK=12,
  CS=10, DC=46, RST=18, BL=45); backlight is PWM-dimmable (settings slider,
  default 50%)
- FT6336 capacitive touch on I2C (SDA=16, SCL=15) — tap / drag pan,
  **long-press 5 s = deep sleep**, touch wakes it
- Native USB-Serial/JTAG (Type-C)
- MicroSD: offline map tiles + offline routing graph
- Powered over USB (e.g. car 12 V→USB adapter)

```

- **Map**: slippy tiles z11–15 from SD (24-slot × 128 KB PSRAM cache, prefetch
  ahead of the car); z16 + out-of-area tiles fall back to WiFi when connected.
- **Navigation**: the phone streams route windows (≤256 pts), position,
  next-turn + next-next maneuver, clock, ETA, weather and speed-camera alerts
  over BLE. The board interpolates/extrapolates fixes so the map scrolls
  continuously and turns heading-up.
- **Offline routing**: `routing.rng` (whole-Vietnam RNG2 spatial index) is
  window-loaded around the current view on ROUTE press; tap start → tap stop →
  A* path in ~270 ms for a ~10 km route. Gated on the **OFFLINE RTE** setting.
- **Render**: ~28 fps cap (35 ms frame), ~11 ms rotate + ~19 ms DMA push.

## Build & flash (ESP-IDF 5.5.5)

```bash
# one-time: source the IDF environment (paths on this machine)
export IDF_TOOLS_PATH=/Users/tungdl/Documents/Eink/.espressif
export IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH=/Users/tungdl/Documents/Eink/.venv
source /Users/tungdl/Documents/Eink/esp-idf/export.sh

cd ESP32_OSM_NAV/build && ninja all
ESPTOOL_PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodem101 ninja flash
```

Notes: kill any serial logger (`pkill -f "Python -u -"`) before flashing — a
stale logger holds the USB port and the flash fails. The board's USB-Serial/JTAG
is flaky; retry the flash if it fails transiently. `car_nav.bin` is ~1.8 MB
(88% of the app partition free).

## SD card contents

```
/sdcard/<z>/<x>/<y>.png|jpg    offline map tiles (standard slippy z/x/y layout)
/sdcard/routing.rng            whole-Vietnam routing graph (120 MB RNG2)
/sdcard/config.txt             offline_route=0/1 (UI setting)
```

## Offline map tiles (SD)

> **Want a big map (e.g. all of Vietnam) or your own tile server?** See
> [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) — it covers running a local
> `overv/openstreetmap-tile-server` in WSL2 and downloading large areas
> (whole-Vietnam z15 ≈ 962k tiles) without tripping OSM's bulk-download
> protection. The quick path for a small area around Bến Thành is below.

The firmware reads tiles from `/sdcard/<z>/<x>/<y>.png` (falls back to `.jpg`).
For the default Bến Thành view you want **z11–z15** (the app's offline range);
z16 and far areas fall back to WiFi when connected. Card must be **FAT32**.

**1. Estimate how much you need (optional)**

```bash
python3 scripts/estimate_area.py --bbox 106.36,10.35,106.92,11.12 --min-zoom 11 --max-zoom 15
```

**2. Download tiles**

```bash
python3 scripts/download_offline_tiles.py \
  --center-lat 10.7718 --center-lon 106.6982 \
  --min-zoom 11 --max-zoom 15 --radius-km 5 \
  --out tiles_hcmc --threads 6
```

- Produces `tiles_hcmc/<z>/<x>/<y>.png` from `tile.openstreetmap.org`.
- Keep `--radius-km` small and `--threads` low: OSM's tile policy is for light,
  personal use. The script sends a descriptive User-Agent and refuses to save
  OSM's "access blocked" placeholder. Alternatives are noted in its header
  (e.g. Carto Voyager: `https://a.basemaps.cartocdn.com/rastertiles/voyager/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`).

**3. Shrink to JPEG (optional — ~3× smaller, more tiles per card)**

```bash
python3 scripts/convert_png_to_jpg.py --dir tiles_hcmc --quality 80
```

Writes `z/x/y.jpg` beside each PNG and deletes the PNG by default. The firmware
tries `.png` first, then `.jpg`, so either works.

**4. Get them onto the SD card**

- **Card reader (recommended)** — copy the `z/` folders onto the SD root:
  ```
  /sdcard/11/<x>/<y>.png
  /sdcard/12/<x>/<y>.png
  ...
  ```
- **Over USB (no card removal)** — with the board in SD reader mode
  (`src/sd_upload.c`):
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/upload_tiles_serial.py --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101 --dir tiles_hcmc
  ```
  ⚠️ The board's native USB-Serial/JTAG drops bytes on bursts — if tiles come
  back missing/corrupt, use the card reader instead.

**5. Verify**

```bash
find tiles_hcmc -name '*.png' | wc -l     # count tiles you downloaded
# on the board: zoom/pan the area — tiles should pop in from SD with no WiFi
```

**Embedded fallback (no SD, no WiFi):** a tiny set of z16 Bến Thành tiles can be
baked into the firmware as JPEG via `scripts/fetch_tiles_embed.py` →
`scripts/gen_embedded_tiles.py` → `src/map_tiles.h` (decoded by tjpgd). It's
only ~4 tiles — a boot fallback, not a replacement for SD coverage.

## BLE protocol (phone → board)

GATT: service `5a7e1000-…`, characteristic `5a7e1001-…` (WRITE/NOTIFY).
Binary frames preferred, XML accepted as fallback:

```
frame: [0xAA 0x55] type len_lo len_hi payload
 0x01 route : zoom(u8) count(u16) lat0/lon0(i32×1e7) + deltas(i16×1e5)
 0x02 pos   : lat(i32×1e7) lon(i32×1e7) spd(u8) hdg(u16) sl(u8)
 0x03 nav   : dist(u16) modId(u8) slen(u8) street
 0x04 eta   : h(u8) m(u8) alen(u8) arrive
 0x05 clock : h(u8) m(u8)
 0x08 nav2  : next-next maneuver (same as 0x03)
 0x09 camera: dist(u16) type(u8)   (dist=0 clears)
 0x07 weather: tempC(s8) hum(u8) code(u8) slen(u8) text
```

## Power consumption

This is a **continuous navigation display** — it redraws the map ~28×/s while
driving, so it draws current the whole trip. The numbers below are **estimates
from datasheet/typical values** — verify with a USB power meter on your own
board. All figures at 5 V (board input).

### Active (driving, backlight at default 50%)

| Component | Current | Notes |
|-----------|--------:|-------|
| ESP32-S3 @ 240 MHz (CPU + PSRAM + SPI + BLE RX) | ~140 mA | dual-core, octal PSRAM, radio connected (RX-dominant) |
| ILI9341 panel (refresh) | ~10 mA | VCI/VDDI draw; SLEEP IN drops it to ~µA |
| Backlight @ 50% (128/255) | ~30 mA | **dominant draw** — full ≈ 60–80 mA, 0 = off |
| SD reads (avg, tiles cached in PSRAM) | ~15 mA | bursty on new-tile loads |
| 5 V→3.3 V LDO + misc | ~5 mA | regulator + LED + quiescent |
| **Total** | **~200 mA** | **≈ 1.0 W** |

A car USB port (≥0.5 A) runs it at ~40 % of its rating — no concern while
driving.

### Deep sleep (long-press 5 s, or auto)

| Component | Current |
|-----------|--------:|
| ESP32-S3 deep sleep (RTC + touch wake on GPIO17) | ~10 µA |
| ILI9341 SLEEP IN + backlight off | ~100 µA |
| LDO quiescent + leakage | ~10 µA |
| **Total** | **~0.12 mA** |

### Battery duty-cycle example (corrected)

Say you drive **2 h/day** and sleep the other **22 h**:

| Mode | Current | Time | Energy |
|------|--------:|-----:|-------:|
| Active | 200 mA | 2 h | 400 mAh |
| Deep sleep | 0.12 mA | 22 h | 2.6 mAh |
| **Daily total** | | | **≈ 403 mAh** |

- **5000 mAh USB power bank** (3.7 V): ~5000/403 ≈ **12 days** of 2 h/day driving.
- **2×AA 2500 mAh NiMH** (boosted to 5 V): ~2500/403 ≈ **6 days** of 2 h/day,
  minus boost/LDO losses.

> The old README's "150 days on 2×AA" came from a **watch-style** design that
> slept 30 s between brief WiFi fetches and lit the display only ~30 min/day
> (and its JPEG row was also 100× off). That design no longer exists — this
> board drives a live map continuously, so the number that matters is the
> **~200 mA active draw**, i.e. power it from the car and treat the display as
> the main cost. To stretch a battery: lower the brightness slider (backlight is
> >50 % of draw) and use deep-sleep standby when parked.
